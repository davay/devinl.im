## Overview [â¤´](https://jobs.devinl.im)

So this is my first blog post ever (hooray!), and my aim here is to concisely 
write about the **motivation**, **general architecture**, and **design decisions** 
behind this site.

First, the idea:

1. What is it? 
    - It's a site that scrapes jobs directly from company portals.

2. Why?
    - I'm about to graduate with my Masters in Data Science soon, 
    and it's generally a good idea to apply to recently posted jobs over old postings.
    However, your options to do this are usually quite cumbersome:
        - You can manually checking each company's site everyday.
        - Some sites let you setup notifications individually.
        - You can download browser extensions that checks for page change on a timer.
        - There was actually one site I found that seems to be doing this: 
        [JobRadar](https://www.jobradar.live/), but they're missing a lot of sources.

3. How? 
    - Historically, the hard part in building something like this are usually the scrapers. 
    You'd handcraft a scraper for each company's site, which will eventually break and need updates. 
    As you scale the number of sources, it becomes a neverending cycle of creating and updating parsers.
    - Instead of doing that, we can now just use LLMs to identify and 
    extract relevant information to our desired schema -> no more building parsers!

## The Solution
